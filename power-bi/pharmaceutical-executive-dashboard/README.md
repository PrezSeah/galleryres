This report was made for the international Pharmaceutical company. It is aimed at monitoring business processes and staff performance. The company offices are distributed throughout Europe and the European part of Russia. Sales managers in offices contact local pharmacists and promote the company’s products.

 

The dashboard is performed following a three-level logical structure. Cards located on the first one represent Key Performance Indicators. We highlighted the achievement of sales and networking targets as well as the percentage of positive responses and number of contacts per day. Sales target defines monetary sales value, networking one - the number of potential clients has been called. Positive responses percentage is those clients who showed company’s product commitment. 

 
The map and Tornado visual are located below, on the second level. There are cities highlighted by green and red on the map. Red ones are places where sales targets were not achieved. Tornado is showed the distribution of sales and contacts targets achievement by specializations. 

 
The bar chart and matrix on the third level illustrate details of every department and sales managers’ results. 

 
We have made an attempt to develop a concise one-page report showing the most relevant data.
